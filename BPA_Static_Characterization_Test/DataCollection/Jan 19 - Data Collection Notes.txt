James's 20mm BPA Adventures

Collect Data for 20mm BPA: 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BPA length: 25.3 cm 
22.8 cm(measured from clamped end to end)

Diameter :20mm

Max contraction length (measured clamp end to end @ 620kPa):  17.3 cm
Contraction: resting length - max contraction length =  22.8 cm - 17.3 cm = 5.5 cm

NOTE: Data Saved as 23 cm due to not having original (unclamped) length available at start.

 -------------------
Kinked: 0.9 cm
-------------------
Kinked: 1.9 cm

Data Jumped (load cell bolt sliped some) on second to last data set, will repeat the data set to be sure all data is good
-------------------
Kinked: 1.9 cm

Repeated data point

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BPA length: 15.0 cm 
 12.0 cm(measured from clamped end to end)

Diameter :20mm

Max contraction length (measured clamp end to end @ 620kPa):  9.5 cm
Contraction: resting length - max contraction length =  12.0 cm - 9.5 cm = 2.5 cm

Note: Data Saved as 12 cm due to not having unclamped length available at start. Attemped to resolve the load cell bolt slipage problem by 
inserting a block of nuts and duct tape and using a hose clamp to hold it in place.

BPA length: 30.0 cm 
 27.5 cm(measured from clamped end to end)

Diameter :20mm

Max contraction length (measured clamp end to end @ 620kPa):  20.7 cm
Contraction: resting length - max contraction length = 27.5 cm - 20.7 cm = 6.8 cm
