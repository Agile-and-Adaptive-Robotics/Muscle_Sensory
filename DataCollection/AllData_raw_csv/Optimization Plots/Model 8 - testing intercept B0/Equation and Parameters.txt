Model: (using compile alldata)
	Force = c(1) + c(2)*(1-Erel)^2 + c(3)*Pressure

Description: This model focuses on the shifting of model's intercept (B0) term. 

10mm: Pressurizing
	c(1) 	-366.9449
  	c(2)	 329.3102
    	c(3)	 0.6785
10mm: Depressurizing
 	c(1)	-300.6856
  	c(2)	284.6008
   	c(3)	 0.5872
20mm: Pressurizing

 	c(1)	-721.1431
  	c(2)	748.7470
   	c(3)	1.7610


20mm: Depressurizing

 	c(1)	-676.4303
  	c(2)	574.5064
 	 c(3)	  1.9615

Comments: slope is consistent for 10mm but not for 20mmdata. AGAIN! Treat 10mm and 20mm as different systems. 

20mm: slope is very random but its ok since I haven't add anyterm for the slope(B1) yet. This is expected.
