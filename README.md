# Muscle-Sensory
Repository for sharing and storing muscle sensory project related information.
- BallisticShield has solid models for creating ballistic shield to protect experimenters from potential catastrophic BPA failure.
- BPA_End_Caps contains solid models for different types of BPA end caps.
- BPA_Static_Characterization_Test contains files and folders for projects that attempt to characterize the relationship between isometric force, pressure, and contraction. Mostly from Lawrence's incomplete Master's project.
- Leak-Fill_tests contains files from Ben Bolen's mechatronics final project. It is designed to test how quickly a BPA can inflate, and a second test to measure how much pressure a BPA might leak over time.
- Muscle_length_sensory should contain files for real-time muscle length sensory projects. It has files from Jake Chung's Master's project, but doesn't appear to have the files from Connor B.'s Master's project using LiquidWire.
- Muscle_Tension_Sensory contains files for muscle tension sensory projects. Currently it has files from part of Jordan Huddleson's Master's project.
- Pulse testing contains files pertaining to force testing of isometric BPAs using pulsing of BPAs. Current has FrequencyIterationBPATestingCode2 contains an Arduino file that is designed to pulse BPAs in a static jig. It was a project by David P., helped by others (including Cody S.). Will include Mo's testing, too.
